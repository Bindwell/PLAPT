PLAPT is a state-of-the-art tool for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity, crucial for accelerating drug discovery processes. Our model leverages transfer learning from pretrained transformers like ProtBERT and ChemBERTa to achieve high accuracy while requiring minimal computational resources.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Processing**: Extremely lightweight prediction module allows for incredibly high throughput affinity prediction with cached embeddings.
- **Transfer Learning**: Uses pretrained models to extract rich protein and molecule features.
- **Versatile Usage**: Uses just 1D protein and ligand sequences as strings for input. Has a command-line interface and Python API for easy integration into various workflows.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves top performance on benchmark datasets.

## Model Architecture

PLAPT uses a novel branching neural network architecture that efficiently integrates features from protein and ligand encoders to estimate binding affinities:

This architecture allows PLAPT to process complex molecular information effectively and highly efficiently when coupled with caching.

## Quick Start

### Installation

For extra assistance installing please see our [Bindwell AI]([https://chatgpt.com/share/6744e111-b818-8008-be2b-a55556aba9b6](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-EZBMf8gIt-bindwell-ai))

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trrt-good/WELP-PLAPT.git
   cd WELP-PLAPT
   ```

2. Choose one of the following installation methods:

   #### Option A: Using Conda (Recommended)
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate plapt
   ```

   #### Option B: Using Python Virtual Environment
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```
   For macos or linux, run:
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
   For windows:
   ```bash
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```
   Then install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Using PLAPT

PLAPT can be used via command line or integrated into Python scripts.

#### Command Line Interface

Predict affinity for a single protein and multiple ligands:

```bash
python3 plapt_cli.py -t "SEQUENCE" -m "SMILES1" "SMILES2" "SMILES3"
```

Predict affinities for multiple protein-ligand pairs:

```bash
python3 plapt_cli.py -t "SEQUENCE1" "SEQUENCE2" -m "SMILES1" "SMILES2"
```

Save results to a file:

```bash
python3 plapt_cli.py -t "SEQUENCE" -m "SMILES1" "SMILES2" -o results.json
```

#### Python Integration

```python
from plapt import Plapt

plapt = Plapt()

# Predict affinity for a single protein and multiple ligands
protein = "MKTVRQERLKSIVRILERSKEPVSGAQLAEELSVSRQVIVQDIAYLRSLGYNIVATPRGYVLAGG"
molecules = ["CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=CC(=NN2C3=CC=C(C=C3)S(=O)(=O)N)C(F)(F)F", 
             "COC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=CC(=NN2C3=CC=C(C=C3)S(=O)(=O)N)C(F)(F)F"]

results = plapt.score_candidates(protein, molecules)
print(results)

# Predict affinities for multiple protein-ligand pairs
proteins = ["SEQUENCE1", "SEQUENCE2"]
molecules = ["SMILES1", "SMILES2"]

results = plapt.predict_affinity(proteins, molecules)
print(results)
```

## Docker

You can also run the model using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image locally:

   ```bash
   docker build -t plapt .
   ```

   Or pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub:

   ```bash
   docker pull cford38/plapt:latest
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all --rm --name plapt -it plapt /bin/bash
   # docker run --gpus all --rm --name plapt -it cford38/plapt:latest /bin/bash
   ```
> [!NOTE]
> This image does not include all of the model weights, which will be downloaded the first time you run PLAPT inside in the container.
